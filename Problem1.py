##Objective
##For the first stage, you will write a bot that displays a greeting, its name, and the year it was created. First impressions count!
##Your program should print the following lines:
##Hello! My name is {bot_name}.
##I was created in {birth_year}.
##Instead of {bot_name}, print any name you choose and replace {birth_year} with the current year (four digits). You don't need to take any input at this stage.

#Define variables for later use
bot_name = 'Mycroft'
birth_year = 2026

print(f"Hello! My name is {bot_name}.")
print(f"I was created in {str(birth_year)}.")
